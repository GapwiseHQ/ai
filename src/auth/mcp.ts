/**
 * Project the pinned SDK's registered tool registry into a conservative
 * `tools/list` contract for directory clients. Tool registration happens
 * elsewhere: the shared handler wrapper registers the stateless public-campus
 * tools and `app/api/mcp/route.ts` registers the OAuth-protected private tools.
 *
 * Public tools intentionally have no OAuth `securitySchemes`; private tools
 * carry `OPENAI_TOOL_META`, which this adapter mirrors to the root field for
 * clients that need it. The projection preserves exact destructive semantics,
 * makes omitted non-destructive annotations explicit, and narrows selected
 * descriptions to factual capability text rather than model-behavior instructions.
 *
 * ChatGPT currently requires root-level `securitySchemes` in tools/list while
 * the pinned MCP SDK v2 only serializes custom auth declarations via `_meta`.
 * Remove that compatibility mirror when the SDK gains first-class root-level
 * serialization, while preserving the public/private per-tool auth boundary.
